This workshop aims to bring together people working on
[Universal Dependencies](http://universaldependencies.github.io/docs/) (UD)
treebanks
for [Turkic languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkic_languages).
The workshop will be held in conjunction with the [UniDive 2nd WG3 meeting](https://unidive.lisn.upsaclay.fr/doku.php?id=meetings:wg:wg3-2-meeting)
in Istanbul on 8 September 2023.
We also aim to facilitate online participation.

The focus of the workshop will be _consistent_ annotations
across different treebanks.
We are also interested in linguistic phenomena in Turkic languages
that are not easy (or even elegant) to annotate with the current
[UD guidelines](https://universaldependencies.org/guidelines.html).

Other topics, new treebanks for Turkic languages,
(linguistic) research done on the treebanks,
and other use of treebanks for research and practical applications, are welcome.

The workshop is supported by the
[UniDive COST action project](https://www.cost.eu/actions/CA21167/).

For the afternoon discussions, we have prepared a list of Turkish sentences, considering the current treebanks and their issues. The set of Turkish sentences that demonstrate various issues raised by the participants with glosses and English translations can be found [here](sentences.pdf). We intend to work on the translations or similar sentences demonstrating these issues in other Turkic languages during the workshop. You can find the _conllu_ file of the Turkish sentences [here](ws-sents-tr.conllu). For reference, also they are in [this page](sents) in plain text. If possible, we will also prepare a list of sentences for other Turkic languages, based on translations and their particular issues. We will discuss the issues in the sentences, and try to come up with solutions. Other sentences and translations are very much welcome.

## Call for abstracts

We invite abstracts for short presentations (15 minutes + 5 minutes of
Q&A) on topics concerning UD Turkic treebanks.  The maintainers of
present treebanks, and those who are preparing new treebanks are
strongly encouraged to introduce their treebanks, and discuss
interesting or difficult cases of annotation.

If you are interested in presenting your treebank in this workshop,
please submit a short abstract (100 to 200 words) of your talk through
<tt>[easychair.org/conferences/?conf=udturkic2023](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=udturkic2023)</tt> before **August
28, 2023 (23:59 UTC)**. The abstract should include brief information
about the treebank that you are maintaining or building, as well as
the issues you would like to discuss (briefly) in your presentation.
Abstracts on other topics concerning the UD Turkic treebanks are also
welcome. The abstracts will receive light review from the organizers,
and are mainly intended for planning and informational purposes.
